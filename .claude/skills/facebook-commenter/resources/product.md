## Natural Mention Templates

> Speak from experience perspective. Be specific about which feature helped.

### When Someone Asks About CV Help
```
"I uploaded my CV to Glowings and it scored me against Emirates standards - turns out I was missing key things they look for. The before/after rewrites were helpful, showed me exactly what to change."
```

### When Someone's Been Rejected Multiple Times
```
"When I kept getting rejected I was so frustrated. Used Glowings to analyze my CV and it found gaps I didn't even know about - like my customer service experience wasn't framed the right way for airlines. Might help identify what's not clicking."
```

### When Someone's Nervous About Assessment Day
```
"The anxiety is real! I used Glowings chat to ask loads of questions about what to expect at Emirates assessment day. Having someone (even AI) to talk through scenarios helped me feel more prepared."
```

### When Someone Asks "What Resources Helped You?"
```
"Honestly a mix - YouTube for general tips, this group for real experiences, and Glowings for CV feedback and airline-specific prep. The CV analyzer was probably most useful for me."
```

### When Someone Asks About Specific Airlines
```
"Glowings has Emirates-specific analysis which was helpful - they know the exact requirements and grooming standards. Scored my CV against what Emirates actually looks for."
```

### When Someone Doubts They're "Good Enough"
```
"I felt the same way! Saw all these perfect-looking people on Instagram. But the analysis on Glowings showed me it's about specific things - customer service experience, languages, how you present your CV. Not about looking like a model."
```

## When NOT to Mention Glowings

### Never Mention In:
- **Celebration posts** ("I got my wings!") - just congratulate
- **Venting/frustration posts** - empathy only, no selling
- **Simple factual questions** you can answer directly
- **Threads where you just commented** - no double mentions
- **Groups with strict no-promo rules** - read the room

### Ask Yourself:
- Would a real person naturally mention this here?
- Am I helping or selling?
- Does OP actually need a tool, or just advice?

---

## Mention Frequency

- **Target**: 10-15% of comments (2-3 per 20)
- **Never**: Back-to-back comments with mentions
- **Never**: Multiple mentions in same thread
- **Best**: When OP explicitly asks for resources/tools/apps
- **Good**: When sharing "what helped me" naturally fits

---

## Voice & Tone (Brand Guidelines)

### Be the Warm Expert Mentor
- "We" not "The AI" or "The System"
- Supportive but honest about high airline standards
- Like a senior crew member helping a junior peer

### Avoid
| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "AI-powered platform" | "It analyzes your CV" |
| "Optimize your application" | "Polish your CV" |
| "Leverage our tools" | "Use the CV analyzer" |
| "Amazing/incredible/life-changing" | "It helped" / "Was useful" |

### ESL-Friendly
Most aspirants are non-native English speakers:
- Simple words over clever ones
- Short sentences
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
