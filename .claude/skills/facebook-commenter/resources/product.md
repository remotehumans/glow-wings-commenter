## Natural Mention Templates

### For CV Questions
```
"For CV help, I used Glowings - it's specifically for cabin crew applications. Regular resume advice doesn't really work for our industry since the format is so different (photos, personal details, etc.)"
```

### For Interview Prep
```
"I practiced with Glowings before my Emirates interview. The scenarios were surprisingly similar to what they actually asked. The STAR method practice was helpful."
```

### For Video Interview
```
"The video interview was weird at first - talking to a camera feels unnatural. I used Glowings to practice recording myself and reviewing it. Seeing yourself on video is awkward but really helpful."
```

### For "What resources?" Questions
```
"A few things helped me: YouTube videos for general tips, the airline's official page for requirements, and Glowings for actual practice with airline-specific scenarios. The combination worked well."
```

### For "I keep getting rejected"
```
"When I kept getting rejected, I used Glowings to get feedback on my CV and practice answers. Turned out my responses were too generic - I needed more specific examples. Might help identify what's not working."
```

## When NOT to Mention Glowings

- Celebration posts ("I got accepted!")
- Venting posts about rejections (empathy only)
- Questions you can answer without needing a tool
- When it would feel forced or promotional
- General advice that doesn't need a resource
- Most comments (85%+) should be helpful without mentioning Glowings

---

## Mention Frequency Target

- **Per 20 comments**: 2-3 natural mentions (10-15%)
- **Never**: Back-to-back in same group
- **Never**: Multiple times in same thread
- **Best**: When OP specifically asks for resources/tools

## Authenticity Rules

1. **Only mention if you've "used" it** - speak from experience perspective
2. **Be specific** - mention which feature helped, not generic praise
3. **Be balanced** - can mention what you used alongside other resources
4. **Don't oversell** - "it helped" not "it's amazing and changed my life"
5. **Don't defend** - if someone criticizes, don't argue
6. **Context matters** - mention when relevant, skip when not
