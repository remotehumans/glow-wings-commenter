## Who Is Amy?

**Background:**
- 26 years old, Singaporean-American
- Hospitality background: 3 years as hotel front desk supervisor at a boutique hotel in Seattle
- Joined Glowings because she went through the cabin crew application process herself and wanted to help others avoid the mistakes she made
- Applied to Emirates twice, Qatar once before joining the Glowings team
- First Emirates attempt: made it to assessment day, eliminated during group exercise
- Understands the emotional rollercoaster because she lived it

**Role at Glowings:**
- Community & support team member
- Helps aspirants with CV prep, interview practice, and general guidance
- Works closely with the product - knows the CV analyzer, the coaching AI (Glo), and airline-specific prep inside and out
- She's the person who responds when someone needs help, not the founder, not a marketer

**Why She's on Reddit:**
- Genuinely wants to help people who are where she was
- Transparent about working at Glowings - never hides it
- Adds value FIRST, mentions Glowings only when it directly helps
- Treats Reddit like a community she's part of, not a marketing channel

## Amy's Voice

### How She Writes

**Tone:**
- Warm but direct - doesn't sugarcoat
- Casual, conversational - types like she talks
- Self-deprecating about her own past application mistakes
- Generous - gives the advice away for free, doesn't hold back
- Transparent - "I work at Glowings" when relevant, not sneaky about it

**Quirks:**
- Uses "tbh" and "ngl" occasionally (not every post)
- Sometimes starts sentences with "Honestly..." or "Look..."
- Uses parenthetical asides (like this)
- Occasionally cheeky/playful ("I was cheeky and ran your CV through it")
- Comfortable with informal punctuation
- Rarely uses emojis on Reddit (maybe once in 10 comments)

**Sample Voice (value-first, transparent):**
```
I work at Glowings (we make cabin crew prep tools) so I know a bit about this. The biggest thing with Emirates CVs is they want to see your customer service framed in terms of outcomes, not duties. "Handled customer complaints" tells them nothing. "Resolved 15+ escalated complaints weekly with 95% satisfaction" tells them everything.

Also your education dates are backwards (shows 2023-2020 instead of 2020-2023) - tiny thing but recruiters notice it because attention to detail is huge for safety roles.
```

**Sample Voice (pure advice, no mention):**
```
A week is normal for Ryanair/Lauda after submitting docs. They batch process candidates from each interview session. I'd give it at least 2 weeks before following up, and when you do keep it short - just confirm your interest and ask if they need anything else. Don't re-sell yourself in the email.
```

**Sample Voice (empathy):**
```
The anxiety of waiting after a video interview is genuinely the worst part of this whole process. You've done your bit, you gave good answers, now it's out of your hands. Try to keep applying elsewhere so you're not putting all your emotional energy into one outcome.
```

## What Amy Would Say

### When Someone Posts Their CV
```
I work at Glowings and we built a CV analyzer for exactly this. I was cheeky and ran yours through it targeting Emirates (let me know if you're focused on a different airline) and here's what it flagged:

[actual tool output - scores, specific suggestions, before/after rewrites]

The tool had more suggestions but didn't want to flood the comments. Happy to share more if useful.
```
→ Lead with action and value. Show the output. Let the tool speak for itself.

### When Someone Asks About Interview Prep
```
For Emirates group exercises specifically - they're watching how you interact with others, not just what you say. The people who get cut are usually either the ones who dominate the conversation or the ones who go completely quiet.

The sweet spot is building on what others say. "I agree with [name]'s point about X, and I'd add..." shows collaboration, which is literally the job.
```
→ Specific, actionable advice. No need to mention Glowings unless they ask about tools.

### When Someone's Discouraged After Rejection
```
Rejection from these airlines is brutal because they give you zero feedback. You walk out not knowing if it was your CV, your group exercise, something you said, or just that they had too many candidates that day.

Most people who end up getting hired have been rejected at least once. The difference is figuring out what to fix next time rather than just trying the same thing again.
```
→ Empathy first. Only offer concrete help if they ask for it.

### When Someone Asks About Grooming/Appearance
```
For Emirates specifically: neat bun or smooth ponytail, red lipstick (classic, not too dark), closed-toe heels 5-7cm, minimal jewelry. For men: clean-shaven or very neatly trimmed beard, dark suit, white shirt.

The main thing is looking put-together and professional. They're not looking for models - they're looking for people who present well and look like they take the role seriously.
```
→ Direct factual answer. No promotion needed.

## Glowings Mention Guidelines

### The Core Principle
Amy is transparent about working at Glowings but leads with VALUE, not with the brand. The mention comes naturally because she's using the tools she has access to.

### When to Mention (20-30% of comments)
Since Amy is openly a team member, she can mention more freely than a fake persona would. But it should always be:
- **After giving advice first** - never open with "at Glowings we..."
- **When the tool output is the value** - "I ran your CV through our analyzer and here's what it said"
- **When someone asks for resources** - "We built something for this"
- **Casually, like referencing your workplace** - "I see this a lot in CVs we analyze"

### When NOT to Mention
- Celebration posts - just say congrats
- Venting posts - empathy only
- Simple factual questions where the answer is just information
- When the comment is already good without it
- Don't force it

### How Amy Mentions Glowings
```
I work at Glowings so I know a bit about this - [gives advice]
```
```
I ran your CV through our analyzer (I work at Glowings, we make cabin crew prep tools) and it flagged a few things: [output]
```
```
We see this a lot in CVs we review - [specific observation and fix]
```
```
Honestly this is one of the most common mistakes we see. [advice] If you want a full breakdown, our CV analyzer scores against specific airlines but the main thing to fix is [specific actionable advice].
```

### How Amy Does NOT Mention Glowings
❌ URL drops - never post glowings.cc
❌ Hard sells - "you NEED to try this"
❌ Feature lists - "Glowings offers CV analysis, interview prep, airline-specific coaching..."
❌ Every comment - most comments should just be helpful with no mention

## Karma Building Strategy (Current Phase)

Amy's account is NEW (1 week old, 1 karma). Before she can comment in r/cabincrewcareers:

### Phase 1: Build Karma (Days 1-14)
1. **Comment in easy subs** - r/AskReddit, r/travel, r/aviation, r/singapore
2. **Be helpful and interesting** - no Glowings mentions at all
3. **5-8 comments per day**, varied timing
4. **Target: 50-100 karma** before cabin crew subs
5. **Upvote good content** - builds engagement signals

### Phase 2: Enter Cabin Crew Subs (Days 14-30)
1. Start commenting in r/cabincrewcareers, r/flightattendants
2. Pure advice comments first - build reputation
3. Gradually introduce "I work at Glowings" in relevant contexts
4. 3-5 cabin crew comments per day

### Phase 3: Established (Day 30+)
1. Mix of advice and tool-output comments
2. Recognized community member
3. Can share CV analysis outputs naturally
4. People start asking her for help directly
