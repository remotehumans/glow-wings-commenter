> Claude AI skill that writes comments indistinguishable from your actual writing style.

A marketing automation framework using Claude Skills and Playwright MCP for authentic community engagement. Features personalized comment generation, target community selection, daily tracking, batch execution, and lead identification.

**✨ Currently supports Reddit** — easily extensible to Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, and other platforms by adding personalization files.

## What is This?

Auto-Commenter is a Claude AI skill that:
- **Learns your writing style** from your actual comments
- **Analyzes posts deeply** to understand context and intent (not keyword-based)
- **Writes authentic comments** that pass 16-point quality checklist
- **Tracks activity** across subreddits with daily quotas
- **Identifies leads** automatically based on your product fit
- **Runs in batch mode** to fill daily quotas across multiple communities

Unlike typical bots that produce obvious automated comments, this system replicates your unique voice and provides genuine value.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rokpiy/auto-commenter.git
cd auto-commenter
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Style

**Create personalization file:**
1. Collect 8-10 comments you've written (various topics, lengths, tones)
2. Ask your LLM: *"Analyze these comments and create a personalization guide"*
3. Paste the result into `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/personalization_reddit.md`

### 3. Customize Target Communities

**Configure subreddits:**
1. Ask your LLM to analyze your target subreddits
2. Paste community rules, tone, and good topics into `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/subreddits.md`

**Optional - Add product info:**
- If promoting a product, add details to `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/product.md`

### 4. Run

**Single comment:**
```
"Write one comment on r/YourSubreddit"
```

**Batch mode (fill daily quota):**
```
"Fill today's quota"
```

📖 **Detailed setup:** See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
