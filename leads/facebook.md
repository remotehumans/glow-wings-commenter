## Lead Engagement Strategy

### In Comments
- Provide genuinely helpful answer first
- Mention Glowings naturally if relevant
- Don't push - let them discover value

### Follow-up
- Don't DM unsolicited (feels spammy)
- If they engage with your comment, continue conversation
- If they ask for more resources, then suggest Glowings
