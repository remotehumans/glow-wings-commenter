## Account Selection Logic

When selecting an account for commenting:

1. **Check ACTIVE accounts** with remaining daily quota
2. **Select account with**:
   - Lowest activity today (distribute load evenly)
   - Membership in target group
   - No recent rate-limiting warnings
3. **If all active accounts at daily limit**:
   - Use warming accounts for light engagement only (likes, reactions)
   - Never comment from warming accounts
